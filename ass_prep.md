## [Interview Practice Problems: Asking Questions](https://launchschool.com/lessons/28467827/assignments/cec18cce)

## My PEDAC:

### Framework:

T: Trip-wires: The hidden difficulties that aren't apparent on first reading. These must be teased out if you're going to avoid blind-corners. These can be expressed as questions.
R: Read the problem 3 times
A: Answers (this is a place to write any answers you have been given)
  - Each answer should have a test case written for it.
P: Rewrite problem in your own words

E: Analyse Examples
D: Objects/Arrays? 
A: - blocks (arrays are shelves, Objects are coat hooks)
A: - Forklifts
A: - with coding terms
C:
T: test cases

### Checklist

- (At each step ask questions and WRITE DOWN THE ANSWERS)

- Create a section for Questions & Answers
  - Don't forget to ask if arrays can be sparse.
- Create a section for hidden difficulties (AKA trip-wires)
- Read Question and examples 3 times
  - After the 1st time say to yourself: "It looks easy, but there are hidden difficulties"
- Rewrite question in your own words, breaking it down into logical parts.
- Go through all examples noting what they demonstrate and what they don't.
- Data: Does this problem better fit Array's (unordered, use the index) or Objects (access properties directly). Think of which methods might be useful.


- A1: Describe the problem as though it is being done by a baby with letter-blocks.
  - Go back to original question and see if it still fits
- A2: Write out the algorithm again at a high level (abstract)
  - What are the distinct responsabilities?
  - Go back to original question and see if it still fits
- A3: Write the algorithm using coding language (lower level)
  - Include expected outcome at each step
- C: Rewrite the final algorithm in code
