## [Interview Practice Problems: Asking Questions](https://launchschool.com/lessons/28467827/assignments/cec18cce)

## My PEDAC:
    
P: Rewrite problem in your own words
    Inputs/Outputs:
    R: rules
    Q: questions & answers

E: Analyse Examples
    T: create test cases ( the interviewer will not be able to answer "have I covered all of the edge cases, but they can tell you if a test should return true or false)

D: 



A: -

A: - with coding terms

C:

T: test cases

### Checklist

- (At each step ask questions and WRITE DOWN THE ANSWERS)

- Read the problem 3 times
- Create a section for Questions
  - Each answer should have a test case written for it.
  - Don't forget to ask if arrays can be sparse.
- Read Question and examples 3 times
  - After the 1st time say to yourself: "It looks easy, as always, but as always there are hidden difficulties"
- Rewrite question in your own words, breaking it down into logical parts.
- Go through all examples noting what they demonstrate and what they don't.
- Data: Does this problem better fit Array's (unordered, use the index) or Objects (access properties directly). Think of which methods might be useful.


- A1: Describe the problem as though it is being done by a baby with letter-blocks.
  - Go back to original question and see if it still fits
- A2: Write out the algorithm again at a high level (abstract)
  - What are the distinct responsabilities?
  - Go back to original question and see if it still fits
- A3: Write the algorithm using coding language (lower level)
  - Include expected outcome at each step
- C: Rewrite the final algorithm in code


### Olly chat:

- cord for jobs

### topics to study:

- Language syntax, types, and flow control
- Functions, variables, and scopes
- Arrays and objects
- Language built-in methods on String and Array
- Mutability of values and objects
- Pure functions and side effects
- Regular expressions (what's covered in our book)

### general problem solving topics you will be expected to demonstrate:

- Be able to build and communicate a clear plan towards solving a given problem
- Fluent with JavaScript's built-in list processing abstractions and higher-order functions
- Be able to write code that follows clear and idiomatic abstractions
- Be able to validate assumptions, debug issues, and fix any problems
- Recognize where and when helper functions can make your job easier
- Good code style

### Interview Study Guide

- This interview is going to assess your basic JavaScript programming and problem solving skills.

- In this interview, you will be expected to follow the process we covered in the last lesson, "A General Problem Solving Approach," to solve a coding challenge. You will have 40 minutes to answer it. It is as follows:
  - Understand the problem
  - Examples/test cases
  - Data structure and algorithms
  - Verify your algorithm against the examples
  - Start coding


### General communication and presence:

- Think, speak, and code deliberately
- Accuracy in concepts and terminologies
- Stay calm

### Things to include in the assessment:

    - save callbacks in different variables, so that the function can adapt to different use cases. Pass functions as arguments.

### Mattic 2.11.24

- Practice questions:
    - https://edabit.com/user/6vfjruFp8ZpRSi3AT
    - https://edabit.com/collection/SjWvg4gA8vpgZnLL7
    - https://edabit.com/collection/QcMwhyqrjLzqupHj4
    - https://ryandej.medium.com/ls216-practice-problems-e68c3df04be4
  - Max 10 test cases
  - Hacker Rank problems
  - Lots of problems to do with Object manipulation
  - Find the flow chart in the course of what to ask when given information.
  - Even with good question asking that reveal the implicit requirements, expect for there to be extra test cases. So expect your solution to be rendered incomplete.
  - (Time limit is soft)
  - People fail because they panic
  - Problem will be surprisingly easy - this is a trap.
  - You may have to do a 2nd pedac - but you can sort of rush it (?)
  - deffo reach out to other students.
